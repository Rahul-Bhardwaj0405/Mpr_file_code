Recommendations for Improvement
Handle Complex Validation Rules: In the future, you may want to handle more complex validation rules, such as:

Cross-field validation (e.g., validating that Amount cannot be negative if Status is "Completed").
Conditional rules based on other fields or external data.
Error Reporting: Instead of just logging errors, consider collecting error messages for each row and returning them to the user. This would allow you to process and report validation issues in batches.

Performance Optimization: For large datasets, you might want to:

Optimize the validation logic by applying certain checks (like data type validation) earlier in the processing pipeline.
Consider parallelizing the processing of data chunks for better performance when dealing with very large files.
Test Validation Rules with Different Data: Ensure that you test the validation logic with various edge cases, such as missing fields, invalid data types, and mismatched indexes, to ensure your code handles them gracefully.
